The name "Reflective Praxis" owes something to Donald Sch&ouml;n's fascinating book, *"The Reflective Practitioner"*, which explores how professionals such as doctors, architects, and engineers go about solving problems through what he calls "reflection-in-action". That notion of "reflection-in-action", a synthesis of theory and practice that involves ongoing evaluation of actions and their effects, is sometimes referred to as *praxis*. Sch&ouml;n argues that professional solve problems by applying *praxis* in a kind of "reflective conversation with a problem". Given that *praxis* includes *reflection*, the phrase *reflective praxis* could be considered redundant. Or, it could be considered a kind of "meta-praxis" that involves reflecting on existing praxis and taking actions to improve that praxis. Obviously, I prefer the latter interpretation.
