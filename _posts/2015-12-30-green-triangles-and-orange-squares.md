title: Green Triangles And Orange Squares

<img src="/images/pixabay-wooden-toys-674888_1280.jpg" /> In his book, *"The Reflective Practitioner"*, Donald Sch&ouml;n recounts an interesting lesson conducted at MIT as part of a training program for teachers. In the lesson, a group of teachers watched a video of two young boys engaged in playing a simple game of verbal communication. The two boys were at a table, separated by an opaque screen. The boy on one side of the screen had a set of blocks of various shapes and colors, arranged in a pattern. The boy on the other side of the screen had an identical set of blocks, but those blocks were not arranged in any particular way. The goal of the game was for first boy to give the second boy verbal instructions that would allow the second boy to recreate the pattern. However, although the teachers watching the video felt that the first boy had "well-developed verbal skills", within a few instructions the second boy was clearly going astray.  

Was the second boy simply bad at following instructions? That was apparently what the teachers initially believed. Then one of the teachers pointed out that early in the instruction sequence the first boy had told the second boy to do something with a green square. Which was problematic, since the set of blocks included *green triangles* and *orange squares*, but **no** green squares. Going back through the video the other teachers saw that their colleague was right. And that things had gone rapidly downhill after that one incorrect instruction, even though the second boy had been trying hard to follow the instructions he was given.  Suddenly, the second boy didn't seem "bad at following instructions" at all. He was doing the best he could to make progress in a situation that had evolved from a foundational error. 

There's an obvious lesson in this story for teachers: don't just assume that your students are stupid if they seem not to understand how to use the things you're teaching. Instead, try to understand the reasoning they use when misapplying what you've taught, so that you can find the foundational errors that may be leading them astray.  

But I think there are also some lessons here for engineers, or even people in general, as well. 

For a start, you can think of the game itself as a metaphor for the client/engineer relationship. It's not clear why the second boy didn't ask "what green square?". Maybe he was prohibited from doing so as part of the game. But *you're* not prohibited from asking your client for clarification when they ask you to do something that seems irrational. Conversely, it's important to make sure that any communications with your client are clear and accurate. Make sure you're not talking about green triangles (or, worse, green squares) when you should be talking about orange squares.

Moving above the level of the game itself there are, I think, several lessons we can take from Sch&ouml;n's story:

 * Make sure you're trying to solve the right problem. In the story, the problem was initially viewed as "the second boy is bad at following instructions", but the actual problem turned out to be "communication between the boys contained an early error". Trying to solve the first problem, by making the second boy better at following instructions, will be an exercise in frustration since it isn't a real problem.

 * In the same way that one wrong instruction early in the pattern-making sequence leads to all sorts of confusion, a poorly understood or communicated requirement can lead to a confused design. It's worth expending some time confirming that your understanding of the requirements for a system really matches what the client has in mind. And that what the client has in mind actually makes sense (no green squares!).

 * If a client or co-worker is doing something that makes no sense, put yourself in their position and try to understand the reasoning that led them to their viewpoint. The people you work with probably aren't stupid, but they may have a very different understanding of the situation, or a different set of facts, than you do.

I'm sure there are other lessons here too. Sch&ouml;n's story is a simple one, but it provides rich fodder for reflection about communication, problem solving, and collaboration.
