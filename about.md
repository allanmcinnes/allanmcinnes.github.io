Hi! I'm Allan McInnes. I've had a meandering career in engineering. It's involved several different industries, and included a couple of extended visits to academia. The one constant through all of those industry and career changes has been my interest in software, how to build better software, and how to get better at building software. As Richard Guindon once said, "writing is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is". In that spirit, these notes represent my attempt to reflect on the practice of engineering in general and software development in particular, and to clarify my thinking by writing it down.

Thanks for reading!
